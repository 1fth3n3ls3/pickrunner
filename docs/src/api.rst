Building The Documentation
--------------------------

Here are the steps to rebuild this documentation:

1. Make sure that the scripts folder is visible in the PYTHONPATH
2. TODO
2b. If new Python modules are added, make sure to rebuild their pages, using
    TODO. Afterwards, add the page to api.rst.


Python Documentation
--------------------


Most (all?) of the documentation is just for the Pickrunner GUI so mileage will
vary. The main class of-interest are :class:`pickrunner.gui.BehaviorControl`.
For an example of how it's implemented, check out
:class:`pickrunner.mayarunner.MayaBehaviorControl`.
